## What the solution does
The solution is built using React, Redux and Styled-components. And the API-calls are made by using thunks with the GitHHub client library Octokit.

I used the GitHub API to build a search engine where you can search for GitHub users and display a details page about them and their repos. In the details page there is also a function to star the repo. Due to the fact that I would've had to make an API-call for wach single repo to see whether a repo had previously been starred by you or not, I choose to, for now, not to implement the visual indicator for whether the repo had been starred or not.

When it comes on how to deal with Github REST API, I decided to use Octokit for a few reasons:
1. It's GitHubs own client library made for their API specifically
2. It's something new for me to learn since I'm already comfortable fith fetches and promises
3. It reduces the amount of code quite a lot, made it easier to read and write

# Github API Token
In order to no add the Github token directly in the repository (this is a bad practice and should be dicoraged,specially for open source public projects), I decided to add the token as an environmental variable which then I added to Netlify deploy options. Of course, this token will be publicly available when loading the website but is a compromise I decided to take for now, as personal private tokens like the one generated by Github should not be added to client applications as anyone with that token could call the Github API on my behalf. To properly use Github API in a production setup, we would need to integrate with Github Auth / Apps in a backend setup in order to let the user of the site to login with their Github credential and get a temporary valid token to use. 

# What would I add with more time
- With more time I would have added pagination. I did spend some time trying to add it but didn't manage and felt like it was consuming to much time so I decided to move on with other things instead. I did find several solutions on how to do it  with React but it was always using only the local state. Since I was using Redux I wanted to be consequential in my usage.

- I would have liked to make the styling a bit more professional as well as the UX and UI.

- Also immidiate feedback in the search. Meaning to render search results simultaniously as typing. But due to GitHub having restrictions on how many API-calls you can make I decided against this.

- Add a toaster for the stars using a library like React-Toastify https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify

- Error management connected to the API

- If I would develop this for an application that is not a test I probably would have used a UI-library. For example material-ui. 

# Instructions on how to run the application on a new computer (it is OK to restrict it to a specific OS or environment)
To run the application locally you will need a GitHub API-token and either add it in the client.js file or as an environmental token in the terminal.

# My plan
1. Build the basics: 
    1. Reducers
    2. Thunks
2. Build up the routes
3. Build basic rendering
4. Style
5. Add stretch goals if time: 
    1. Pagination
    2. Add stars

# Thoughts

My take aways are: 
1. It was a fun prject to build and I felt like I learned from it. 
2. That it's easy to get caught up in the coding and sometimes forget to commit often enough, something I'm trying to remind myself of and improve on.
3. Sometimes it's good to take a step back, whether that's active procrastination when focusing on something else for a bit or stepping away from the computer for a while.
4. Finding time is easier when you don't have a sick child at home :)
